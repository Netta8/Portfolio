              At the age of 16, influenced by my mother's career as a
              Kindergarten teacher, I initially chose to follow a similar path.
              However, as time progressed, I began to feel that my ambitions
              were outgrowing that career trajectory. Seeking greater
              challenges, I pursued studies in Business Administration, leading
              me to discover my affinity for the IT domain, specifically in
              Programming. My most recent technical journey involved a
              comprehensive Weiterbildung as a Full Stack Web Developer at the
              Digital Career Institute in Berlin.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              This experience has endowed me with proficiency in a range of
              technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React,
              Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git, Linux, Windows, as well as
              tools like VS Code and MS Office. I possess practical experience
              in developing web-based software and possess a strong command of
              git-based versioning systems.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Furthermore, my background in Kindergarten teaching has nurtured
              my ability to work collaboratively, showcasing my adeptness at
              multitasking, always maintaining a comprehensive perspective, and
              embodying qualities such as patience and empathy â€“ traits that
              enable me to efficiently solve problems and contribute effectively
              to a team.
